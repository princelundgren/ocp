# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v3.26.0 — 2026-07-27

Maintenance release. One user-visible change — advertised `maxTokens` now tells the truth — and four rounds of repairs to the machinery that is supposed to catch mistakes: a schema for the model SPOT, a release-job bug that would have shipped an empty release body, and the integration-test harness that had been failing 4 runs in 5 without anyone noticing.

Every PR carried an independent fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10). Two reviewers refuted the author's stated rationale while the change itself stood; in both cases the rationale was rewritten rather than the finding waved off, and one reviewer retracted its own earlier finding after the evidence was re-derived. `server.mjs` is untouched in this release, so no `cli.js` citation applies.

### Changed

- **`maxTokens` now matches the CLI registry (#195).** The previous values were not uniform: six entries were 16384 and `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` was 8192. Every Opus entry and `claude-sonnet-5` go to **64000**, `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` to **32000** — the `max_output_tokens.default` each model declares in the compiled CLI 2.1.220 registry. Every model except `claude-sonnet-4-6` (1.95x) moves by the same 3.91x — haiku included, from its lower base. This corrects **advertised metadata only**: `models.json` is the SPOT (ADR 0003) and every value in it should be the truth about the model. **It changes nothing about how OCP behaves.** OCP never enforces `maxTokens` — `buildCliArgs` passes no output-token flag to the CLI at all — and OpenClaw addresses a local OCP over `openai-completions`, whose request field (`max_completion_tokens`) appears nowhere in this repo. The value is consumed only by clients that choose to honour it, via `setup.mjs` / `scripts/sync-openclaw.mjs` / `ocp-connect`. **Expect no change in answer length or quota burn.** `ocp-connect`'s independent family table moves to the floor over each family's current `models.json` members (opus 64000, sonnet 32000, haiku 32000), since prefixes cannot distinguish versions. Its unknown-id fallback stays at **8192** — the registry's global minimum, held by `claude-3-5-haiku` and `claude-3-5-sonnet`, which are the only real ids that reach it (`claude-3-5-*` matches no family prefix).

### Added

- **`models.schema.json` — the model SPOT now has a schema, enforced in CI (#196).** `models.json` declares it via `$schema`, and `test-features.mjs` validates the SPOT against it using the repo's **own** `validateJsonSchema` from `lib/structured-output.mjs` — no new dependency. A malformed entry now fails the build instead of surfacing downstream in OpenClaw. The schema's description names exactly which keywords that validator enforces and which it **silently ignores** (`minimum`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `uniqueItems`, …), so nobody adds a constraint that buys nothing; those go in `test-features.mjs` instead. Guard tests cover 8 distinct corruptions plus uniqueness and whitespace on every name field.

### Fixed

- **`release.yml` would have produced an empty release body on any repo state without `CHANGELOG.md` (#202).** The no-changelog branch set an output pointing at a notes file it never wrote, and the create step then read a missing path. Rare, but it fails exactly when you least want it to — during a release. The branch now writes the file.
- **The `ltBoot` integration harness was failing 4 runs in 5 (#199, #209).** Measured with a control arm — full suite × 4 concurrent × 50 rounds against unmodified `main` and against the fix — clean runs went **42/200 → 200/200**, with `EADDRINUSE` **246 → 0**. Four distinct races: two tests gated on a stdout marker and then asserted on a **stderr** line written 12 `console.log` calls later (different pipes, nothing ordering them); every fixed port replaced with `ltFreePort()` (the old 39321–39364 range sits *inside* Linux's default ephemeral range, so CI was more exposed than a Mac); `close` instead of `exit` where a test reads a buffer after termination; and retrying teardown against grandchildren still writing into the temp dir. **#203 is NOT fixed and remains open** — it has never reproduced on macOS (0 across both 200-run arms) and all four sightings are Linux CI, one of them on #205 inside this very release. #211 adds a manual `workflow_dispatch` harness to hunt it on Linux with a pre-#204 positive control. Diagnostics now print exit/signal/closed/elapsed/Node version plus a head+tail sample of both streams — sized so the sample provably reaches the one line that distinguishes "booted" from "refused", with a test pinning that budget so it cannot silently degrade.

### Internal

- **Guard comments on the asymmetric cache-key construction (#200)** — `structuredHash` and `dedupKey` carry deliberately different guards, and the resemblance invites a "cleanup" that would collapse them. Now documented at the site.
- **`AGENTS.md` § "Testing: reaching faults inside `server.mjs`" (#197)** — writes up the fault-injection method these fixes needed, including the `--stack-size` lever and why running a flaky scenario *in isolation* removes the very concurrency that causes it.
- **`ocp-connect` documentation corrections.** Its family table is the floor over each family's *current* `models.json` members — not over the registry family — and its unknown-id fallback stays at 8192, the registry's global minimum. Both had comments asserting otherwise. Its model table and fallback remain **untested**; tracked as #210.
- **Known gap, deliberately not fixed here: `contextWindow` does *not* match the registry (#213).** The same CLI 2.1.220 bundle declares `window:1e6, native_1m:true` for `claude-opus-5`/`-4-8`/`-4-7` and `claude-sonnet-5`, while `models.json` says 200000. Unlike `maxTokens`, this cannot be corrected as metadata: `derivePromptCharBudget` takes `max(contextWindow) × 3` across **all** entries, so one 1M model would raise `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` from 600k to 3M for every model — including `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, which really is 200k native — turning clean OCP-side truncation into upstream API rejections. Fixing it needs per-model prompt budgets (ADR-level). Recorded so this release's "the SPOT tells the truth" claim is not read as covering it.

## v3.25.0 — 2026-07-27

Minor release. Headline: **Claude Opus 5** joins the model list and the `opus` alias now resolves to it. Alongside it, two `server.mjs` correctness fixes found by review rather than by users — a monotonic in-flight-counter leak, and cache keys that were hashing the alias string instead of the model it resolves to. The three TUI/prompt fixes that landed after v3.24.0 are included here too.

Every code PR carried an independent fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10); #192 additionally went through the external codex gate, which is what surfaced the cache-key defect. No new endpoint, no new env var, no new `cli.js` wire behavior.

### Added

- **Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`) (#192).** New `models.json` entry — `/v1/models` goes 6 → 7 and OpenClaw picks it up on the next `ocp update` (via `scripts/sync-openclaw.mjs`). Verified against the installed CLI rather than assumed: the compiled `claude` 2.1.220 bundle carries `latest_per_family:{fable:"claude-fable-5",opus:"claude-opus-5",sonnet:"claude-sonnet-5",haiku:"claude-haiku-4-5"}`. Availability confirmed with a live `claude -p --model claude-opus-5` completion on the subscription pool. `claude-opus-4-8` is retained for pinning.
- `contextWindow` is deliberately **200000**, not Opus 5's native 1M. Two reasons, both verified: (1) `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` is a **single global** budget — `derivePromptCharBudget` takes `max(contextWindow) × 3` across *all* entries (`lib/prompt.mjs`), so a 1M entry would raise the truncation ceiling to 3,000,000 chars for `claude-haiku-4-5` too, which is genuinely 200k native, converting clean OCP-side truncation into an upstream API rejection; (2) OpenClaw scales its history budget linearly off this value (`contextWindow × maxHistoryShare × SAFETY_MARGIN` = `× 0.6`, plus an oversized-message threshold at `× 0.5`, per `compaction-planning` in OpenClaw 2026.7.1), and its own bundled registry hardcodes 200000 for Claude — the upstream request to raise it to 1M ([openclaw#22979](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/22979)) was closed *not planned*. A new regression test pins the invariant so a future 1M entry has to be a deliberate, reviewed change. Raising it for real needs per-model budgets — tracked separately, ADR-level.

### Changed

- **The `opus` alias now resolves to `claude-opus-5` instead of `claude-opus-4-8` (#192).** Every request that names `opus` — and OpenClaw's opus entry — moves to Opus 5 on upgrade. This mirrors what the CLI itself defaults to (`latest_per_family.opus` above), the same reasoning as #168's `sonnet` → `claude-sonnet-5` repoint in v3.23.0. **Pricing is unchanged** ($5/$25 per MTok; CLI registry `pricing:"tier_5_25"` for both Opus 4.8 and Opus 5), so this carries no cost change. Pin `claude-opus-4-8` explicitly to stay on the previous model.

### Fixed

- **Cache keys hashed the alias, not the model it resolves to (#194).** `model` enters `cacheHash` exactly as the client sent it, so a request for `"opus"` was cached under the literal `"opus"` — and since `models.json` is read once at boot while the SQLite `response_cache` outlives a restart, repointing an alias kept serving the **old model's** answers under it until TTL expiry. That would have silently defeated this release's own `opus` repoint for anyone running with the cache on. All three call sites now hash `Object.hasOwn(MODEL_MAP, model) ? MODEL_MAP[model] : model`, which fixes the normal, structured **and** single-flight keys at once and covers `legacyAliases` for free, with precise invalidation (only the repointed alias's entries change key) rather than a whole-cache flush. (`hasOwn` rather than a bare lookup: `MODEL_MAP` is a plain object, so `MODEL_MAP["__proto__"]` would return a truthy *object* and not even fall through to the `|| model` guard.) **Also closes a latent gap from #177:** the structured and dedup keys never passed `configEpoch` at all, so a `CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` change — the original #176 scenario — kept serving structured answers composed under the old config, live since #153. Found by the external codex review of #192.
- **In-flight request counter leaked permanently on a pre-spawn throw (#193, reported by @konceptnet in #180).** `stats.activeRequests` was incremented ~40 lines before the child spawn, while its only decrement is reached through that process's events — so any synchronous throw in between (`buildCliArgs`, env assembly, the spawn decision, or `spawn()` itself) leaked `+1` forever, and `/health` and `/status` over-reported in-flight work monotonically. The increment now sits immediately after `activeProcesses.add(proc)`, structurally pairing it with the decrement; no reconciliation pass and no try/catch. Observability-only field, so no admission decision changes.
- **TUI: the host `CLAUDE.md` could leak into proxied turns (#187, contributed by @sumlin).** The TUI pane now spawns with `--safe-mode`.
- **TUI: `shift+tab to cycle` is accepted as an input-ready marker (#188, contributed by @sumlin).** Claude renders one of two ready-state footers depending on the build — the classic `? for shortcuts` hint, or `shift+tab to cycle` (as part of `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle)`) on newer 2.1.x. The matcher only knew the classic string, so on those builds it silently reported "never ready": every boot timed out with `tui_pane_not_ready`, and with the warm pool on, every pre-boot failed.
- **`OCP_LOCAL_TOOLS` no longer hard-codes a tool list in its wrapper (#191, closes #185).** The positive wrapper claimed a fixed set of tools regardless of `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS`, so a narrowed tool surface was described inaccurately to the model.

### Testing

- The response-cache and counter fixes ship with **mutation-proven integration tests** built on the existing `ltBoot` child-process fixture (real `server.mjs`, fake `claude` binary, so no quota cost). The counter test reaches a synchronous fault *inside* `spawnClaudeProcess` from environment alone — no production fault hook — by running the child under `--stack-size=200` to lower the spread-throw threshold enough to fit Linux's `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`. Suite: **447 → 457** across this release (per PR: #188 +1, #187 +1, #191 +0, #194 +4, #192 +3, #193 +1).

## v3.24.0 — 2026-07-21

Minor release. Headline: two long-requested **OpenAI-compat features** land — **multimodal vision** (`image_url` parts) and **structured outputs** (`response_format` / JSON schema). Also: the prompt-char budget now derives from the model SPOT instead of a hand-set constant, an agentic-turn bug that dropped the model's final answer is fixed, and `OCP_LOCAL_TOOLS` supports the OpenClaw-backend use case. Four of the six landed from external contributors (@vvlasy-openclaw). Every code PR carried a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10); no new endpoint, no new `cli.js` wire behavior.

### Added

- **Multimodal vision — OpenAI `image_url` parts (#154, contributed by @vvlasy-openclaw).** `/v1/chat/completions` forwards OpenAI `image_url` content parts to `claude` as native Anthropic image blocks via `--input-format stream-json` (the CLI's own contract — no invented wire shape, verified live). Base64 `data:` URIs by default; remote `http(s)` URLs are off unless `CLAUDE_IMAGE_ALLOW_URL=1` (and even then OCP never fetches them — no SSRF surface). Byte/count caps (`CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, `CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGES`, `CLAUDE_MAX_IMAGE_TOTAL_BYTES`), all fail-closed on a misconfigured value. TUI mode returns `400 images_unsupported_in_tui_mode` (it can't carry image blocks) and an image present only in a `system` message returns `400` rather than being silently dropped. README § "Images / Multimodal".
- **Structured outputs — OpenAI `response_format` (#153, contributed by @vvlasy-openclaw).** `/v1/chat/completions` honors `response_format: { type: "json_schema" | "json_object" }` so OpenAI-SDK clients (Home Assistant AI Tasks, Honcho, scripts) get machine-parseable JSON in `content`. Validates against the schema (incl. `$ref`/`$defs` + `allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf` — the shapes the OpenAI SDK emits), retries with a stronger instruction up to `OCP_STRUCTURED_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3, fail-closed), and on exhaustion returns OpenAI's own `refusal` field (200/`content:null`) rather than an invented error. Cyclic-`$ref` schemas fail closed (no stack overflow); a pathologically deep model reply returns a refusal, not a 500 (#181). Single-flight dedup + structured-keyed cache bound the cost. Class B.1 (ADR 0006). README § "Structured Outputs".
- **SPOT-derived prompt-char budget (#179, ADR 0009).** `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` default now derives from `max(models.json contextWindow) × 3 chars/token` (600,000 today) instead of the hand-set 150,000 (~37.5k tokens) that silently under-delivered the advertised window ~5×. `CLAUDE_MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` and the settings API remain absolute overrides; a garbage value fails closed to the derived default.
- **`OCP_LOCAL_TOOLS` — positive local-tools system-prompt wrapper (single-user, loopback only; default off) (#182, contributed by @vvlasy-openclaw).** The `-p` path prepends a wrapper telling the model it has no local filesystem/shell access — correct for a shared gateway, but it makes a personal instance's model (e.g. an OpenClaw agent on its own local OCP) refuse to use the server-side `claude` tools it legitimately has. `=1` swaps in a positive wrapper. Changes **only the prompt**, never the tool surface (`--allowedTools`/`--disallowedTools` untouched; multi-tenant still disallows the FS surface); it does **not** enable client-side `tool_calls` (still unsupported by design). Fail-closed boot gate mirroring `OCP_TUI_FULL_TOOLS` (ADR 0007): refuses to start under `CLAUDE_AUTH_MODE=multi`, a non-loopback bind, or `PROXY_ANONYMOUS_KEY`. Inert (and logged as such) in TUI mode. The active wrapper is folded into the config epoch so toggling it invalidates the standard response cache. No new `cli.js` wire behavior (reuses the already-cited `--system-prompt` flag).

### Fixed

- **Agentic turns dropped the model's final answer (#183, contributed by @vvlasy-openclaw).** On a tool-using turn, `/v1/chat/completions` returned only the opening preamble ("I'll find the repo…") and silently discarded the post-tool-use final answer: aggregate-`assistant` extraction was gated on `isFirstDelta` (which flips false after the first text), and OCP runs pure-aggregate mode (no `--include-partial-messages`), so each of an agentic turn's several assistant messages after the first was lost. Now guards on `sawTextDelta` and accumulates every assistant message (streaming and buffered paths assemble byte-identically).
- **Deep structured reply returned a 500 instead of a refusal (#181 / #184).** `validateJsonSchema` recurses on the model reply's nesting depth; a ~2000-level-deep reply overflowed the stack → caught `RangeError` → generic 500. A crash-safe façade converts that (only) into a validation miss → refusal; any other throw still surfaces.

## v3.23.0 — 2026-07-17

Minor release. Headline: **the default `sonnet` alias now resolves to Claude Sonnet 5** — a behavior change for every request that omits `model` (pin `claude-sonnet-4-6` by full ID to keep the previous default). Also: Windows-safe upgrade snapshots, two upgrade-system reliability fixes from a live fleet update, the `CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` env var made functional, cache-key honesty for config changes, a billing-policy status correction (the 2026-06-15 `-p` split is PAUSED by Anthropic), and a major README restructure. No new endpoint; no new `cli.js` wire behavior. Every code PR carried a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10).

### Changed

- **Default `sonnet` alias → `claude-sonnet-5` (#168, contributed by @vvlasy-openclaw).** The `sonnet` alias (the model used for every `/v1/chat/completions` request that omits `model`, and OpenClaw's OCP primary via `ocp-connect`) now resolves to `claude-sonnet-5` instead of `claude-sonnet-4-6`. `claude-sonnet-4-6` remains available by full ID for pinning. Mirrors the shipped Claude CLI's own `latest_per_family` mapping (`sonnet → claude-sonnet-5`, verified from binary 2.1.211). Split out from the additive model entry (#152) per Iron Rule 11.
- **`CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is now functional (#175).** The var was read, documented, and echoed on `/health.systemPrompt` but never reached a request (dead since the `APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` retirement). It is now appended (last, trimmed) to the composed system prompt on the default `-p` path via the new pure `lib/prompt.mjs`; TUI-mode panes are unaffected. Unset ⇒ byte-identical composition to before. README § Environment Variables documents it, including the cache caveat below.

### Fixed

- **Windows-safe upgrade snapshot paths (#167, contributed by @nyxst4ck).** Snapshot directory timestamps now use `-` instead of `:` (Windows forbids `:` in names); legacy colon-named snapshots keep parsing, and `listSnapshots` now orders by **parsed timestamp** (with a deterministic name tie-breaker) so mixed legacy/new names sort chronologically — the initial revision's raw-string sort could delete the newest recovery snapshot at the format boundary and was caught in review; regression tests pin the same-hour mixed-format case.
- **`ocp update` reliability — two live-incident fixes (#174, closes #173).** (1) The doctor now runs `git fetch --tags` (offline-tolerant) before computing `latest_version` — previously it compared against the locally cached `origin/main`, so machines that hadn't pulled since a release reported "Already at latest" forever. (2) Post-flight now asserts `/health.version` equals the upgrade target (new `postFlightOk` predicate) instead of accepting any `auth.ok` — a stale orphan process holding the port used to pass post-flight while still serving the old version; the failure message now reports the last-seen version and points at `ss -ltnp`/`lsof -i`.
- **Response-cache key now carries a boot-config epoch (#177, closes #176).** The persistent cache keyed on model+key+params+messages but not on server config that shapes answers (`CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, wrapper text, `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS`, `CLAUDE_NO_CONTEXT`) — changing any of these and restarting could serve stale-config answers until TTL expiry. A sha256 config-epoch is folded into every key; any config change is an instant whole-cache invalidation. One-time side effect: existing cache entries miss once after this upgrade.

### Docs

- **Billing-policy status corrected (#171).** Anthropic **paused** the announced 2026-06-15 `claude -p` billing split on its effective date (official help-article citation in README § How It Works): the default `-p` path currently bills the subscription, and TUI-mode is reframed as the ready-made **hedge** for if/when a reworked change lands. All in-force assertions of the split are now date-stamped and conditioned.
- **LAN mode scoped to chat-class workloads (#171).** New "workload fit" paragraph: multi-device OCP is for text-in/text-out workloads; client-machine coding agents are architecturally out of scope (tools execute on the OCP host).
- **README restructured, 1205 → ~500 lines (#172).** Operations-manual content moved to `docs/lan-mode.md`, `docs/tui-mode.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`, `docs/upgrading.md` (verbatim moves + two canonical dedups; zero content loss verified section-by-section). README keeps the quickstart, the release-kit-pinned reference tables, and summary stubs with links. Plus a staleness sweep (#170): 6-model examples, removal of the never-existed `ocp stop` command, `ocp-connect` claims corrected, current version examples.

## v3.22.1 — 2026-07-17

Minor release: TUI-mode latency and streaming features — **all opt-in and off by default**, so the default request path (`-p` / `--output-format stream-json`) is byte-for-byte unchanged — plus hardening from an independent (Codex) re-review of the streaming work, Windows `claude.exe` startup resolution, and the Claude Sonnet 5 model entry. No new `cli.js` wire behavior and no new endpoint; the new surface is entirely OCP-owned TUI-mode configuration (env vars), startup binary discovery, model metadata, and `/health` observation. Every code PR carried a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10). (Version note: v3.22.0 was prepared but never tagged; its contents ship here as v3.22.1 together with the additions below.)

### Added

- **Claude Sonnet 5 in the model SPOT (#152, contributed by @vvlasy-openclaw)** — `claude-sonnet-5` added to `models.json` (`contextWindow` 200000 / `maxTokens` 16384 / `reasoning` true, consistent with existing entries), exposed via `/v1/models` and the OpenClaw sync. Purely additive: the `sonnet` alias still resolves to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (the repoint is tracked separately in #168). `ocp-connect`'s model classifier now matches on the model *family* prefix (`claude-sonnet`/`claude-opus`/`claude-haiku`) instead of version-pinned prefixes, so current and future versioned IDs register with correct `reasoning`/`maxTokens` metadata. New referential-integrity tests guard that every alias target exists in `models[]`.
- **Windows `claude.exe` startup resolution (#161, contributed by @nyxst4ck, diagnosis credit #147 @Justinsato)** — on Windows, `resolveClaude()` now discovers a native `claude.exe` (`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`, WinGet Links, WindowsApps, then `where.exe`) and rejects npm `.cmd`/`.bat`/`.ps1` shims, which cannot be spawned without a shell — previously startup resolved a shim and failed. A non-`.exe` `CLAUDE_BIN` on Windows is a fatal error with an actionable hint. The macOS/Linux path is byte-for-byte unchanged. Note: this is startup binary resolution only — full Windows support is not yet claimed (snapshot-path portability is tracked in #167).

### Added — TUI mode (all opt-in, default off)

- **Spawn effort control — `OCP_TUI_EFFORT` (default `low`) (#156)** — the interactive `claude` is now spawned with an explicit `--effort` flag. `low` cuts measured TTFT p50 by ~40% and collapses run-to-run variance ~15× versus an inherited `xhigh`; proxied requests rarely benefit from extended thinking. Set `inherit` to omit the flag and restore the pre-flag HOME-dependent behaviour. Banner-verified to stay on the subscription pool (`· Claude Max`); an invalid value warns and falls back to `low`. README § "Environment Variables".
- **Warm pane pool — `OCP_TUI_POOL_SIZE` (default `0` / off) (#158)** — pre-boots up to 4 single-use `claude` panes so a request skips the cold boot: measured end-to-end p50 `10.17s` → `6.00s` (−41%) on a Mac mini (Sonnet 4.6, `--effort low`). Opt-in because each warm pane is a live idle process held whether or not a request ever arrives. Panes are single-use (one turn, then killed and replaced in the background), port-scoped (`ocp-tui-<port>-p<hex>`), and coexist with the zombie reaper by a synchronous drain→reap→resume sweep. README §§ "Environment Variables" + "How It Works".
- **Real SSE streaming — `OCP_TUI_STREAM` (default `0` / off) (#159, #160)** — `stream:true` turns emit real `delta.content` chunks as `claude` generates them, sourced from `claude`'s own `MessageDisplay` hook (registered via `--settings` on the ordinary interactive spawn — banner-verified on the subscription pool). Granularity is block-level, and it moves the *first* byte, not the last. The transcript stays authoritative: streamed text is asserted equal to it at end-of-turn, the auth-banner and truncation gates still run before anything is committed, and a turn whose stream cannot be reconciled is **refused** (SSE error frame, not cached) and counted on `/health` (`tui.streamDivergences`; a silent total-hook-failure is counted separately as `tui.streamZeroDeltaTurns`). Tunables: `OCP_TUI_STREAM_HOLDBACK` (default `100`), `OCP_TUI_STREAM_DIR`, `OCP_TUI_STREAM_POLL_MS`. See ADR 0007 (2026-07-13 amendment). README §§ "Environment Variables" + "How It Works".

### Fixed

- **Streaming auth-banner guard: a null `message_id` on the first hook fire (#160)** — a first `MessageDisplay` fire with a null `message_id` could disarm the auth-banner guard; re-landed after a #159 squash dropped it (`lib/tui/stream.mjs`).
- **Test suite wrote live, unrevoked API keys into the operator's real key store (#163)** — `npm test` had been opening `~/.ocp/ocp.db` (the running server's DB) and writing two junk `api_keys` rows per run (737 accumulated on the maintainer's host), because the isolation the comments claimed was never wired (ESM import hoisting). `keys.mjs` now honors `OCP_DIR_OVERRIDE` under `NODE_ENV=test` and the suite points at a scratch dir; a child-process probe verifies a production process (no `NODE_ENV`) cannot be redirected.
- **Streaming holdback floor + billing-pool observation on failed turns (#164)** — (A1) `OCP_TUI_STREAM_HOLDBACK` now clamps up to the safe floor (`100`) with a boot warning, closing a latent auth-banner leak when an operator set a sub-floor value. (A3) the `cc_entrypoint` (billing-pool) observation is now recorded before the honesty gates that throw, so `/health` no longer goes blind to exactly the failed turns most likely to signal a silent degrade to the metered Agent SDK pool.
- **Test-only key-store redirection vars can no longer reach a server OCP launches (#165)** — (A4) `NODE_ENV`/`OCP_DIR_OVERRIDE` are stripped from every service unit `setup.mjs` writes (`plist-merge`'s `NEVER_PRESERVE`) and from the `ocp restart` manual nohup fallback (`env -u`); #163's overstated "a prod server can NEVER be redirected" comments were softened to name the one residual hand-launch path and the loud `getDb()` "NOT the default" backstop.

### Docs

- **README billing honesty (#162, closes #136)** — removed a feature bullet that promised what the § "honest limits" section forbids.
- **TUI latency plans + streaming-achievability spike (#155, #157)** — measured latency decomposition, backlog, and the `MessageDisplay`-hook streaming prereq spike under `docs/plans/2026-07-13-tui-latency/`.

## v3.21.1 — 2026-07-07

Patch release: three bug fixes from an independent concurrency/session-lifecycle audit, each its own PR with a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10). No new `cli.js` wire behavior, no new endpoint, header, or env var; the `/health` field set is unchanged (only value truthfulness improved).

### Fixed

- **TUI session-scope / boot-reap (#148)** — `lib/tui/session.mjs`'s tmux session prefix is now scoped per-instance by listen port (`ocp-tui-<port>-`) instead of a bare host-wide `ocp-tui-` constant, so a second OCP instance on the same host (e.g. a temporary verification instance) can no longer have its live TUI sessions reaped or `kill-server`'d by another instance's boot/periodic sweep. The one-time boot reap also claims exact-shape legacy `ocp-tui-<8hex>` sessions (pre-fix naming) once, to clean up zombies left behind across an in-place upgrade.
- **`-p` spawn-token mutex + keychain caching (#150)** — the real-HOME token fallback used when the keychain token is within its 5-minute expiry window is now serialized behind a mutex, so concurrent `-p` spawns no longer race the same single-use refresh token against each other (the credential-fork hazard). Added a 30s TTL cache + last-good-label memoization for the keychain read, cutting per-spawn event-loop blocking. The isolation decision (`/health` isolated/real-home reporting) is now re-evaluated per spawn instead of memoized forever, so `/health` no longer misreports a stale decision. New module `lib/spawn-auth.mjs` extracts the pure, unit-testable primitives (mutex, TTL cache, expiry gate, label ordering).
- **Concurrency queue / disconnect handling (#149)** — the shared semaphore now honors a runtime-lowered `maxConcurrent` immediately (previously a decrease was silently ignored until in-flight tasks finished on their own) and wakes queued waiters right away when the limit is raised. Queued `-p`/TUI requests are now linked to the client's HTTP connection via `AbortSignal`; a client that disconnects while queued is spliced out of the queue instead of still spawning `claude` once a slot frees. A singleflight follower whose leader disconnected now retries instead of inheriting a spurious 500, and a queued-then-disconnected request is no longer recorded as a usage failure or logged as an error (quiet disconnect handling).

## v3.21.0 — 2026-06-25

Cleanup + docs release: TUI dead-code removal, docs honesty, and release prep. No new `cli.js` wire behavior; the default path (`CLAUDE_TUI_MODE` unset) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

### TUI dead-code / footgun cleanup

- **A1 — removed inert entrypoint-env path** (`lib/tui/session.mjs`): deleted `resolveTuiEntrypointEnv()` and the redundant env-strip block in `runTuiTurn`. The `{env}` object passed to `spawnSync` (tmux itself) was the wrong target — tmux does NOT forward the spawning process's environment to the pane; the pane's `claude` gets its env exclusively from the `env` prefix string built inside `buildTuiCmd` (verified live 2026-06-01). The spawnSync env is now intentionally minimal (`HOME` only). Behavior is unchanged: `buildTuiCmd` already handled all claude-specific env vars via its prefix string.
- **A2 — removed test-only transcript helpers** (`lib/tui/transcript.mjs`): deleted `encodeCwd()` and `transcriptPath()` exports and the tests that pinned them. Production resolves transcripts exclusively via `findTranscriptPath()` (glob by session-id), which is immune to the exact path-encoding rule. No non-test importers existed (grep confirms). A `// TODO` comment near `findTranscriptPath()` notes that a CI fixture-contract test would make claude-schema drift fail loudly.
- **A3 — removed headless-unusable `--dangerously-skip-permissions` branch** (`lib/tui/session.mjs` + `README.md`): `OCP_TUI_FULL_TOOLS=1` now always takes the `--allowedTools` path. The removed branch pushed `--dangerously-skip-permissions` when `CLAUDE_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=true`; on claude v2.1.x this triggers an interactive bypass-acceptance screen that a headless tmux pane cannot answer → the turn hangs to the wallclock cap and bricks the pane. The working path is `--allowedTools` + scratch-home `settings.json` `additionalDirectories`. `CLAUDE_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` for the `-p` path is unchanged (still used in `server.mjs`).

### Docs

- **Client-tools boundary** (README `§ How It Works`): OCP is a text-prompt bridge only — it does not pass OpenAI `tools`/`functions` or Anthropic `tool_use` blocks to the client. Clients receive assistant TEXT only; client-local tool execution is not supported by design (bypassing `cli.js` = out of scope per `ALIGNMENT.md`).
- **ToS honesty** (README `§ Deployment model & security`): pooling one Claude subscription across multiple distinct people may violate Anthropic's Consumer ToS and risk account suspension by the abuse classifier. The defensible framing is "one person, your own devices" — friends/team sharing is not. The prior language ("account terms are your call") was accurate but understated the risk.
- **"Why OCP" posture** (README `§ Why OCP?`): new bullet making explicit that OCP drives the official `claude` CLI as-is — no OAuth token extraction, no binary patching, no protocol invention — so traffic looks like genuine Claude Code (`cc_entrypoint=cli`).
- **Promotion plan** (`docs/PROMOTION.md`): "stable & visible" strategy covering goal (polish + low-key OSS visibility, NOT growth-hacking given the live ToS/billing risk), pre-requisites (stability first), honest ToS disclosure requirement, items explicitly skipped (multi-backend routing → OLP; gateway model-discovery; raw API passthrough → ALIGNMENT.md scope), TUI toggle as billing-split insurance, and low-key visibility actions. Framed as a recommendation for the maintainer to review, not a committed plan.

### Previously shipped (v3.20.x) — documented here for completeness

- **Default `-p` spawn-home isolation** (v3.20.0 / PR-A): per-request `claude` spawns run in a credential-free minimal scratch HOME (`$HOME/.ocp/spawn-home`, no `.credentials.json`/`settings.json`/plugins) with a neutral cwd and the env token, cutting per-request latency (measured ~10–28s → ~3–7s). Kill-switch: `OCP_SPAWN_REAL_HOME=1`. Active mode shown at startup and on `/health.spawn`.
- **Bounded concurrency wait-queue** (v3.20.0 / PR-B): excess `-p` requests queue (up to `CLAUDE_MAX_QUEUE`, default 16) instead of being rejected; a full queue returns `HTTP 429` + `Retry-After` (not an opaque 500). New env vars: `CLAUDE_MAX_QUEUE`, `CLAUDE_QUEUE_RETRY_AFTER`. Surfaced on `/health.concurrency` + `/health.stats.queueRejections`.
- **`ocp restart`** macOS `bootout`+`bootstrap` (v3.20.0 / PR-B): safe restart command that forces launchd to re-read the plist (unlike `kickstart -k` which reuses the cached env).
- **`/ocp` plugin OpenClaw-2026.5.27 compat** (v3.20.0 / PR-C): gateway plugin updated for the current OpenClaw API version.

## v3.20.1 — 2026-06-13

TUI-mode auth hardening: fixes the recurring `Please run /login · API Error: 401` (the PI231 incident) and reaps leaked defunct `claude` sessions. ([#141](https://github.com/dtzp555-max/ocp/pull/141))

### Fixed

- **TUI 401 / credential corruption (#141)** — interactive `claude` prefers `~/.claude/.credentials.json` over the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var (unlike `-p` mode, where the env token wins). OCP TUI's per-request spawn + `kill-session` cycle raced claude's single-use refresh-token rotation, corrupting the refresh token to an empty string → permanent 401 that `claude /login` couldn't fix (each new spawn re-corrupted it). This bit Linux/file-based hosts specifically (macOS reads credentials from the Keychain, so Mac mini was immune). **Fix:** when `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set, the TUI claude now runs in a credential-free scratch HOME (`<HOME>/.ocp-tui/home`, overridable by `OCP_TUI_HOME`) seeded with onboarding + cwd-trust but **no `.credentials.json`**, so the env token is the only credential and claude never runs the refresh path. Recurrence-proof — a later `claude login` can no longer break TUI. Also: `buildTuiCmd` passes `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to the spawn, and `reapStaleTuiSessions` reaps defunct `claude` sessions (tmux-server-owned zombies) via `kill-server` when no foreign session remains, plus a 15-min idle-gated periodic reap. When the env token is unset, behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged (real-home + credentials.json). Two independent fresh-context reviewers (Iron Rule 10) + a live PI231 portability test (works with a corrupt credentials.json present). Authorized by the ADR 0007 PR-D amendment (Class B).

### Environment variables

- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — when set on a TUI host, TUI authenticates via this long-lived token in a credential-isolated home (recommended; immune to credentials.json corruption).
- `OCP_TUI_HOME` — overrides the TUI scratch home; if you previously pointed it at your real home, unset it to get the credential-isolated default.

## v3.20.0 — 2026-06-10

TUI-mode billing-safety hardening for the 2026-06-15 Anthropic billing split. A 5-dimension multi-agent audit (adversarial verification + live tests on all three hosts — PI231 / Oracle / Mac mini, claude 2.1.104 / 2.1.114 / 2.1.170) found the TUI subscription-pool path could silently bill the metered Agent SDK pool or poison the cache under realistic failure modes. Three PRs, each with a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10) and CI; the default path (`CLAUDE_TUI_MODE` unset) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

### TUI — honesty & cache correctness (#137)

- **C-1** — `callClaudeTui` now throws on a claude-CLI auth-failure banner (e.g. `Please run /login · API Error: 401 …`, `Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 …`) instead of returning it as a real answer, so it is never cached, singleflight-shared, or counted as a model success. Conservative detector (whole trimmed text ≤100 chars + `API Error: 4xx` + auth keyword + no code/quote char); overridable via `CLAUDE_TUI_ERROR_PATTERNS`. Live-reproduced on PI231.
- **C-2** — `readTuiTranscript` distinguishes a complete turn from a wallclock-truncated partial (`truncated` flag); `callClaudeTui` throws `tui_wallclock_truncated` so a partial is never cached or counted as success.
- **C-3** — `verifyEntrypoint` reads the `entrypoint` field from any transcript line, not just `{system, turn_duration}` — some claude builds emit zero turn_duration lines (live-confirmed on Oracle's claude 2.1.114), which previously left the billing-drift assertion blind on those builds.
- **C-4 (paste)** — short prompts (e.g. `hi`) could never pass paste-landing detection; threshold lowered. Live-reproduced on PI231.

### TUI — concurrency & observability (#139)

- **Concurrency** — `OCP_TUI_MAX_CONCURRENT` (default 2) bounds concurrent interactive `claude` boots via a queuing semaphore (`lib/tui/semaphore.mjs`); the slot is released on throw so honesty-gate / spawn failures never leak it; bounded wait-queue → `tui_queue_full` (503). Independent of the global `MAX_CONCURRENT` (8) — a TUI turn is a heavy per-request cold-boot of tmux+claude + up to 120s wallclock.
- **Observability** — additive `/health` `tui` block (`enabled` / `entrypointMode` / `lastEntrypoint` / `entrypointMismatches` / `inflight` / `maxConcurrent`) so an operator can poll for a silent `sdk-cli` metered-pool drift (the audit's top risk) instead of grepping journald. Authorized by the ADR 0007 PR-B amendment under the ALIGNMENT grandfather provision (additive, behaviour-preserving — every pre-existing `/health` field unchanged).

### Operations (#138)

- `docs/runbooks/615-canary.md` — the 2026-06-15 credit-balance canary: quiesce, read the Agent SDK credit balance (manual — no programmatic API exists for that pool; OCP's `/usage` headers are subscription rate-limit data, not the credit pool), one TUI canary turn, confirm `entrypoint:cli` in the transcript, green/red decision tree, periodic auto-mode self-classification mini-canary.
- `docs/runbooks/tui-flip-rollback.md` — flip/rollback per deployment (systemd `daemon-reload`; launchd `bootout`/`bootstrap`, not `kickstart -k`).
- `setup.mjs` auth quick-test gated behind `OCP_SKIP_AUTH_TEST=1` (the `claude -p` probe draws from the metered Agent SDK pool after 6/15).

### New environment variables

- `OCP_TUI_MAX_CONCURRENT` — max concurrent interactive TUI turns (default 2) (#139).
- `OCP_SKIP_AUTH_TEST` — skip the `claude -p` auth probe in `setup.mjs` (default off) (#138).

## v3.19.0 — 2026-06-02

TUI-mode reliability + proxy-purity release. Two fixes diagnosed and verified live on both test hosts (PI231 / Oracle, claude 2.1.104 / 2.1.114), each its own PR with a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10), then an adversarial multi-host test battery (0 hangs / 0 crashes / 0 injection / 0 leaks). The default path (`CLAUDE_TUI_MODE` unset) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

### TUI

- **#130** — Fixed the "stuck typing" hang on large multi-line prompts. Three root causes: (1) terminal-turn detection only recognized `{system, turn_duration}`, which older claude builds (e.g. 2.1.114) don't emit → the reader ran to the wallclock and returned partial text; now also accepts an `assistant` line with a final `stop_reason` (`end_turn`/`stop_sequence`/`max_tokens`), while `tool_use` stays non-terminal. (2) Large prompts pasted via `send-keys -l` delivered embedded newlines as separate Enter events → the prompt never landed; now uses `tmux load-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p` (bracketed paste, atomic). (3) The paste-landed check false-positived on claude's empty curly-quote placeholder → Enter fired into an empty box; now positive-signal-only (`[Pasted text]` / prompt text) with a readiness/paste-verify poll + fast-fail (deterministic ~5s error instead of a 120s wallclock hang).
- **#4** — TUI-mode never injects the host's `CLAUDE.md` / auto-memory into proxied turns. OCP is a proxy: the proxied client (OpenClaw / an IDE) owns its own context and memory. `buildTuiCmd` now always sets `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_MDS` + `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY` (unconditional — proxy purity is not an opt-in). Verified live with a marker `CLAUDE.md`: obeyed by the proxied turn before the fix, blocked after, on both hosts. Residual host-context vectors (managed-policy / `settings.json` / output-styles) tracked in #133. The env is delivered via an `env`-prefix on the tmux pane command (tmux does not forward the spawning process's environment, and `new-session -e` requires tmux ≥3.2 while the cloud host runs 2.7).

## v3.18.0 — 2026-06-01

Hardening release from a multi-agent code audit (1 P0 + 14 P2 + 2 P3 findings, each adversarially verified and independently reviewed) plus three follow-ups (#123–#125). Every change shipped as its own PR with a fresh-context reviewer (Iron Rule 10). The single-user default path (`AUTH_MODE=none`, no TUI) is behavior-identical **except** the `/health` change in #109.

### Security

- **#109 (P0)** — `/health` no longer advertises `PROXY_ANONYMOUS_KEY` to remote callers by default. The `anonymousKey` field is gated behind a new `PROXY_ADVERTISE_ANON_KEY=1` opt-in env var; localhost callers are always exempt. Prevents any LAN-reachable device from harvesting a working, quota-spending bearer credential from the unauthenticated `/health` endpoint. **Behavior change:** `ocp-connect` zero-config Path A now requires the server to set `PROXY_ADVERTISE_ANON_KEY=1`; otherwise pass `--key` or use anonymous access.
- **#114** — Dashboard escapes all DB-sourced strings (key names, usage rows) before `innerHTML`; the revoke button uses a `data-` attribute + listener instead of an inline `onclick` a quote could break out of; `POST /api/keys` validates key names server-side (`[A-Za-z0-9 ._-]{1,64}`).
- **#124** — Dashboard status/plan summary cards escaped too (uniform defense-in-depth over all `innerHTML` sinks).
- **#111** — Streaming error paths strip filesystem paths from claude error text / stderr before sending them to clients (`sanitizeError`), matching the non-streaming path.

### Reliability / correctness

- **#110** — Non-array `messages` is rejected with a 400 (was silently hanging the connection until socket timeout); OpenAI array `content` is flattened into the prompt instead of dumped as raw JSON; a streamed upstream error now emits an SSE `error` frame instead of a success-looking `finish_reason:"stop"`.
- **#111** — `res.on("close")` escalates SIGTERM→SIGKILL on client disconnect (closes a narrow re-occurrence of the #37 concurrency-slot leak on the hottest exit path); `overallTimer` is cleared on semantic completion so a slow-exiting child can't record a spurious post-success timeout; per-key quota is documented as best-effort (bounded overshoot ≤ `MAX_CONCURRENT`, cache hits uncounted).
- **#113** — CLI/installer hardening: `ocp-plugin` restart uses the live uid + `dev.ocp.proxy`/`ocp-proxy` labels and drops the unsafe `pkill` fallback; `ocp-connect` quotes + `chmod 600`s the persisted key; `setup.mjs` XML-escapes and newline-validates injected service-unit secrets.

### Alignment / governance

- **#112** — OAuth token-refresh host (`platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`) re-verified against the compiled cli.js v2.1.154 (`strings`, no live probe) and recorded in `ALIGNMENT.md`; usage-probe and default request model now derive from `models.json` (ADR 0003 SPOT) instead of hardcoded IDs.
- **#123** — The legacy `console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token` host is pinned in the `alignment.yml` blacklist so a future OAuth-host drift hard-fails CI; the blacklist now documents its dual purpose (known hallucinations + pinned wrong-host variants of a verified Class A endpoint).

### TUI

- **#115** — The TUI LAN gate refuses any non-loopback bind (not just literal `0.0.0.0`); the achieved `cc_entrypoint` is asserted each turn and a `tui_entrypoint_mismatch` warning is logged on a silent degrade to the metered sdk-cli pool.

### Refactor

- **#125** — `isLoopbackBind` extracted to `lib/net.mjs`, shared by `server.mjs` and the test suite (was duplicated via a copy-paste mirror).

### New environment variables

- `PROXY_ADVERTISE_ANON_KEY` — opt-in (default off); advertise `PROXY_ANONYMOUS_KEY` on the public `/health` body for remote zero-config discovery (#109).

## v3.17.1 — 2026-05-31

### Fix — code-audit P1/P2 hardening

Fixes from a multi-agent code audit (3 P1 + 5 P2, adversarially verified). The single-user default path (`AUTH_MODE=none`, no TUI) is behavior-identical.

**Availability / correctness (P1):**
- Guard `proc.stdin` against EPIPE — a fast-failing spawned `claude` (auth error, bad model, large prompt) no longer crashes the single-process daemon.
- Add `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException`/`clientError` safety nets + wrap all request-body read loops — a client aborting mid-upload no longer crashes the daemon.
- TUI transcript reader: only `turn_duration` is terminal (was also `tool_use`), which silently truncated any TUI turn that used a built-in tool.

**Security gates / cache integrity (P2):**
- `AUTH_MODE=multi`: the default spawn now passes `--disallowedTools` (Bash/Read/Write/Edit/…) so a guest prompt cannot drive operator-filesystem tools. Single-user path unchanged.
- `/sessions` (DELETE), `/settings` (PATCH), `/logs`, `/usage`, `/status` are now admin-gated (were dispatched before the admin check).
- Streaming path no longer caches an `is_error` response as success (cache-poisoning fix).
- TUI fail-loud guard extended to `none`+`0.0.0.0` (unless `OCP_TUI_ALLOW_LAN=1`) and `+ PROXY_ANONYMOUS_KEY`.
- TUI `send-keys` paste uses `-l` (literal) so a prompt equal to a tmux key token (e.g. `C-c`) is typed, not interpreted.

## v3.17.0 — 2026-05-31

### Provider — default claude invocation ported to stream-json + `--system-prompt` (Phase 6c)

OCP's default (non-TUI) claude spawn moves from `claude -p --output-format text` to `claude --output-format stream-json --verbose --no-session-persistence --system-prompt <wrapper>` (no `-p`). The NDJSON event stream is parsed into the assembled response. Benefits: ~64% per-request cost reduction and anti-hallucination via `--system-prompt` tool-use suppression. Clients see no API change — the OpenAI-compatible request/response shapes are identical. Faithful port of OLP's production-verified implementation; covered by 17 new stream-json parser tests.

⚠️ **Billing note:** from 2026-06-15 this default path carries `cc_entrypoint=sdk-cli` and bills against the Agent SDK credit pool. Use the new opt-in `CLAUDE_TUI_MODE` (below) to keep traffic on the Pro/Max subscription pool.

---

### feat(tui): opt-in CLAUDE_TUI_MODE — serve via interactive claude (cc_entrypoint=cli / subscription pool), single-user only; default stream-json path unchanged

From 2026-06-15 Anthropic routes `claude -p` / `--output-format` invocations to the Agent SDK credit pool (`cc_entrypoint=sdk-cli`). This feature adds an opt-in bridge: when `CLAUDE_TUI_MODE=true`, OCP serves each request via a real interactive `claude` session (no `-p`, no `--output-format`) so it carries `cc_entrypoint=cli` and bills against the Pro/Max subscription.

The complete string response is read from claude's native JSONL session transcript and replayed to callers as a normal OpenAI completion or chunked SSE. Clients see no API change. The default stream-json path is byte-for-byte unchanged when `CLAUDE_TUI_MODE` is unset.

**Security:** single-user / single-operator only. Never enable on a multi-user OCP. See ADR 0007 and README § "Subscription-pool (TUI) mode".

New env vars: `CLAUDE_TUI_MODE`, `CLAUDE_TUI_WALLCLOCK_MS`, `OCP_TUI_CWD`, `OCP_TUI_HOME`.
New ADR: `docs/adr/0007-tui-interactive-mode.md`.
New modules: `lib/tui/transcript.mjs`, `lib/tui/session.mjs` (shipped in preceding commits on this branch).

---

### Model — add claude-opus-4-8

Add `claude-opus-4-8` as the newest Opus to `models.json` (index 0, newest first). Repoint `aliases.opus` from `claude-opus-4-7` to `claude-opus-4-8`. `claude-opus-4-7` remains in the list callable by literal id. `legacyAliases.claude-opus-4` left pointing at `claude-opus-4-7` (no change — legacy alias tracks the prior generation). README Available Models table and model-count references updated accordingly.

---

## v3.16.4 — 2026-05-13

### Refactor — port-literal SPOT + CI guardrail

Closes the structural side of the port-drift cascade addressed by v3.16.2
and v3.16.3. Those two releases reverted plist / plugin / scripts back to
3456 line-by-line, but the underlying invitation to drift — a hardcoded
port literal scattered across six source files — was still intact.

Changes:

- **New `lib/constants.mjs`** — single source of truth for shared literals.
  Exports `DEFAULT_PORT = 3456`, `LOCAL_HOST = "127.0.0.1"`,
  `OPENAI_API_BASE = "/v1"`, `LOCAL_PROXY_URL`.
- **`server.mjs:127`, `setup.mjs:36`, `scripts/upgrade.mjs:137`,
  `scripts/doctor.mjs:84` + `:205`, `scripts/sync-openclaw.mjs:73`** —
  all replaced with imports from `lib/constants.mjs`. Behavior is
  identical; the literal `3456` now exists in exactly one place per
  language (`lib/constants.mjs` for `.mjs`, `ocp` + `ocp-connect` for
  bash, `test-features.mjs` for pinned historical-port tests).
- **`.github/workflows/alignment.yml`** — extended the path filter to
  `setup.mjs`, `scripts/**`, `lib/**`, `ocp`, `ocp-connect`. Added a new
  `port-spot` hard-fail job that greps for any hardcoded `3478` or `3456`
  literal in `.mjs/.js/.ts/.json` outside the EXEMPT_REGEX (which lists
  `lib/constants.mjs`, `test-features.mjs`, the bash CLIs, docs, and the
  workflow itself). Any future PR re-introducing a hardcoded port
  literal will be blocked at CI before it can cascade.
- Doc comments in `server.mjs` env-var summary and `setup.mjs` usage
  banner reworded so the literal `3456` no longer appears as
  documentation text (CI grep is intentionally aggressive — it does not
  parse comments — so doc strings reference `DEFAULT_PORT from
  lib/constants.mjs` instead).

No behavior change for any user. `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` env var remains
the runtime override; the only difference is the unset-env fallback
now flows through one shared constant.

ALIGNMENT.md hard-requirements: this PR modifies `server.mjs` (one-line
import + one literal swap, mechanical). No cli.js operation changed;
the citation requirement does not apply. SPOT principle (Rule 2 spirit)
is the entire motivation.

## v3.16.3 — 2026-05-13

### Fixes — completes v3.16.2 port-drift revert

v3.16.2 reverted the plugin / `openclaw.plugin.json` / README / Mac mini
plist back to `3456` (the historical source default since `593d0dc`), but
missed three places in `scripts/` that still defaulted to `3478`. Those
three lines were the residual cascade source: every time `ocp doctor` or
`ocp upgrade` ran without `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` in the env, they probed
`3478`, reported "OCP not responding" against a healthy 3456 instance,
and (in the case of OpenClaw sync follow-ups on the maintainer's host)
re-introduced 3478 into downstream config.

Changes:

- `scripts/upgrade.mjs:137` — default port `3478` → `3456`.
- `scripts/doctor.mjs:84` — default port `3478` → `3456`.
- `scripts/doctor.mjs:205` — default port `3478` → `3456`.

No behavior change for users who set `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` explicitly; env
still takes precedence. The fix only affects the unset-env fallback,
which now matches `server.mjs:126` and the rest of the codebase.

Test plan: existing `test-features.mjs` cases that pin
`CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT=3478` continue to pass — they use the env path, not
the default.

## v3.16.2 — 2026-05-12

### Fixes — corrects v3.16.1

The v3.16.1 fix was directionally correct (plugin now reads env first, falls back to a hardcoded default) but **the narrative and the hardcoded default were both wrong**.

What v3.16.1 said: "OCP server moved to 3478 default in v3.14+; plugin lagged at 3456."
What is actually true:
- **OCP server source default has been `3456` since `593d0dc` (initial release) and has never changed.** Every line in `server.mjs`, `setup.mjs`, and the `ocp` CLI still uses `3456` as the documented and code-level default.
- The single OCP installation observed on `3478` is the maintainer's Mac mini, whose plist was rewritten with `--port 3478` during a PR #71 dogfood smoke-test accident on 2026-05-08 (see `~/.cc-rules/memory/learnings/subagent_setup_mjs_prod_host_collision.md`). The plist drift was never reconciled back to source default, and v3.16.1 incorrectly canonised the post-accident value as if it had been a release decision.

This release:
- Restores the plugin fallback to `http://127.0.0.1:3456` to match server source default.
- Updates `openclaw.plugin.json` `configSchema.proxyUrl.default` back to `3456`.
- Restores README §"Environment Variables" `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` default to `3456`.
- Plugin reads `OCP_PROXY_URL` env (full URL) first, then `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` env (port only), then falls back to `3456`. Hosts whose OCP plist injects a non-default port must also inject the same `CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT` into the OpenClaw plist for the plugin to follow.
- Maintainer's Mac mini plist was reverted from `3478` to `3456` as part of this release deploy (no source change reflects this; it was a one-host correction).

### Governance

- No `cli.js` citation needed (no `server.mjs` change). ALIGNMENT.md Rule 2 not engaged.

## v3.16.1 — 2026-05-12 (superseded — narrative incorrect; see v3.16.2 erratum)

### Fixes (as shipped — note erratum above)

- **OCP plugin port lag** — `ocp-plugin/index.js` hard-coded `http://127.0.0.1:3456`. ~~While OCP server moved to 3478 in v3.14+,~~ **(corrected v3.16.2: no such move ever happened.)** The Mac mini's plist was on `3478` only as residue from a dogfood accident. Result: `/ocp` slash commands from the home Telegram bot returned "OCP error: fetch failed". v3.16.1 changed the plugin default to `3478` (wrong direction; v3.16.2 reverts to `3456`).

### Governance

- No `cli.js` citation needed (no `server.mjs` change). ALIGNMENT.md Rule 2 not engaged.

## v3.16.0 — 2026-05-10

### Features

- **`ocp doctor --check oauth`** (PR #93) — fast path that runs only the OAuth check, skipping
  version detection / from-version / git operations / models endpoint. ~50ms vs. full doctor's
  ~200-500ms. Use cases: AI agent repair loops, post-`claude auth login` verify, quick health
  gates. Help text in `cmd_doctor_help` now reflects working behaviour.
- **`ocp update --rollback --gc`** — manually garbage-collect old upgrade snapshots.
  Retention policy: keep last 5 snapshots OR snapshots newer than 30 days OR the single most
  recent (always-keep safety net). `--dry-run` previews. Successful `ocp update` runs auto-GC
  at the end of the full path; light path does not (no snapshot created there).

### Behavior changes

- After a successful cross-minor `ocp update`, the auto-GC emits `[gc] removed N old snapshots`
  to stderr if any were collected. Safe to ignore; manual gc is `ocp update --rollback --gc`.

### Governance

- No `cli.js` citation needed (no `server.mjs` change). ALIGNMENT.md Rule 2 not engaged.
- PR #93 (--check oauth) merged separately; this release bundles it with the GC feature.

## v3.15.1 — 2026-05-10

### Fixes

- **doctor: dynamic `latest_version` from `origin/main:package.json`** — v3.15.0 doctor used a hard-coded `latest = "v3.14.0"` fallback, which made any v3.15.0+ install report `kind = upgrade` (against a stale value). `ocp update` would then attempt `git checkout v3.14.0` — a downgrade. Doctor now fetches `git -C ~/ocp show origin/main:package.json` to determine the actual latest version; on failure (offline, fresh clone with no remote), falls back to `currentVersion` so `kind = noop` instead of recommending a downgrade.

## v3.15.0 — 2026-05-10

### Features

- **`ocp doctor`** — health & upgrade-readiness check; primary entry for AI-driven debugging.
  `--json` mode emits a `next_action` with `ai_executable[]` for agents to run verbatim
  and `human_required[]` for steps requiring the user (typically only OAuth).
- **`ocp update` cross-version path** — for cross-minor jumps (e.g. v3.10 → v3.14),
  `ocp update` now runs doctor → snapshot → `setup.mjs` (with the plist env-merge from
  PR #90) → service restart → post-flight `/health` + `/v1/models` verification.
  Same-patch updates retain the existing light path; users see no change for routine
  patch bumps.
- **`ocp update --rollback`** — restore the most recent (or specified) upgrade snapshot.
  Snapshots are saved to `~/.ocp/upgrade-snapshot-<ISO-ts>/` and never auto-deleted.
- **Fresh-install routing** — `ocp update` on installations < v3.4.0 routes to a fresh-install
  flow (with `--yes` to skip confirmation; AI agents pass this). OAuth survives via Claude
  Code's credential store; users do not re-OAuth unless their token was independently broken.
- **AI prompt blocks in README** — §Installation, §Upgrading, and §Troubleshooting each
  start with a copy-paste prompt for Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot, so users can drive
  install / setup / upgrade through their existing AI assistant.

### Behavior changes

- `ocp update` may take 10–30s longer when a cross-minor jump triggers the full path
  (snapshot + post-flight). Patch bumps are unchanged.
- Pre-v3.4.0 installs are routed to fresh-install rather than failing silently or
  half-migrating.

### Governance

- No `cli.js` citation needed (no `server.mjs` change). ALIGNMENT.md Rule 2 not engaged.
- Depends on PR #90 (plist env merge bug fix; merged before this release).

## v3.14.0 — 2026-05-10

### Features (security hardening)

- **Per-key session isolation** (PR #86, S1) — the `sessions` Map in `server.mjs` is now keyed by `${keyName}|${conversationId}` instead of bare `conversationId`. Before this fix, two clients using distinct API keys but the same `session_id` value (e.g. both defaulting to `"default"`) would share the same `cli.js` subprocess and conversation history, creating a cross-tenant leak path. Post-fix each (key, session) pair is isolated end-to-end, extending the per-key cache isolation shipped in v3.13.0 D1 to the session layer.
- **On-disk credential file modes 0700/0600** (PR #87, S2) — `setup.mjs` now creates `~/.ocp` at mode 0700 and both `admin-key` and `ocp.db` at mode 0600. An idempotent `reconcileFileModes()` call in `server.mjs` startup tightens any existing installation to these modes automatically on every launch, so existing prod boxes fix themselves without manual `chmod`. Before this fix, all three files were created at the process's default umask (typically world-readable 0644 / 0755), leaving plaintext credentials readable by other local users.
- **`/api/usage` default scope = self; admin all-keys requires `?all=true`** (PR #88, S3) — the usage endpoint now applies a least-privilege default: anonymous callers receive only their own rows, non-admin authenticated callers receive only their own rows, and admin callers receive only their own rows unless they explicitly pass `?all=true`. When `?all=true` is used, an audit log line is emitted. Before this fix, any admin-token holder could silently enumerate usage data for every key on the server.

### Behavior changes

- **Breaking change for admin tooling**: `/api/usage` no longer returns all-keys data by default. Existing cron jobs, dashboards, or scripts that rely on the admin token seeing all-keys output must add `?all=true` to their request URL after upgrading to v3.14.0.
- **File mode reconcile at server startup** logs a one-line notice per path when mode is tightened (e.g. `[security] tightened ~/.ocp/ocp.db → 0600`). No action is required from the operator; the reconcile is idempotent and silent when modes are already correct.
- **`sessions` Map key is now `${keyName}|${conversationId}` internally.** No client-visible wire change — the `session_id` field in request/response is unchanged.

### Verification

- Stress-test pass: 11/11 phases including S1/S2/S3 security regression checks (Phase E, I, J). 35-minute sustained run, 60 calls, 0 errors, 0 timeouts. RSS dropped 51→47 MB across the window. Per-key cache isolation, singleflight, cache_control bypass, quota enforcement, file-mode reconcile, and scope guard against escalation all verified against running code.

### Governance

- All three PRs (#86, #87, #88) include the explicit `cli.js`-citation-not-applicable disclaimer (per PR #75 pattern) since they are OCP-internal access-control, session-state, and file-permission changes with no corresponding `cli.js` operation to cite.

### No new env vars / no public API surface change beyond the documented breaking change

This release adds no new env vars or endpoints. The only externally visible change is the `/api/usage` scope guard (breaking for admin all-keys consumers; see Behavior changes above).

## v3.13.0 — 2026-05-07

### Features (cache layer hardening)

- **Per-key cache isolation** (D1) — the cache key now includes the API key id, so distinct keys never share cache entries. Anonymous/unauthenticated callers share one `anon` pool. Hash format upgraded to `v2`; legacy v1-format rows orphan and are reaped by the existing TTL cleanup interval (no migration script).
- **`cache_control` bypass** (D2) — when a request carries an Anthropic `cache_control` annotation (top-level or nested in a content array), OCP skips its own cache entirely. The caller is using Anthropic-side prompt caching deliberately, and OCP must not interfere. A `cache_skipped{reason: cache_control_present}` log line is emitted on bypass.
- **Chunked stream replay** (D3) — when a streaming request hits the cache, the cached content is now emitted as multiple SSE chunks (80 codepoints/chunk, codepoint-safe via `Array.from()`) instead of a single large delta. Multibyte characters (CJK / emoji) stay intact.
- **Singleflight stampede protection** (D4) — concurrent identical cache-miss requests now share one upstream `cli.js` spawn instead of spawning N processes. Followers receive byte-identical responses to what the leader returns. All-or-nothing failure semantics: if the leader errors, all followers receive the same error. Streaming-path singleflight is explicitly out of scope (TODO left for follow-up).

### Behavior changes

- `/cache/stats` response now includes additive fields `inflight` and `requesters` (current in-flight singleflight entries and total waiting callers). Existing fields `entries`, `totalHits`, `sizeBytes` are preserved unchanged.

### Governance

- New ADR [`docs/adr/0005-no-multi-provider.md`](docs/adr/0005-no-multi-provider.md): OCP stays single-provider (Anthropic via `cli.js` spawn). Multi-provider gateway refactor explicitly out of scope; cache improvements are explicitly in scope.
- Design spec for this release: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-cache-upgrade-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-cache-upgrade-design.md).

### No new env vars / no public API surface change

This release adds no new env vars or endpoints. All four improvements are internal correctness/concurrency upgrades to the existing `CLAUDE_CACHE_TTL`-gated cache layer. No client-observable wire shape change.

## v3.12.0 — 2026-04-25

### Features

- **Streaming heartbeat** — opt-in SSE comment frame (`: keepalive\n\n`) emitted during silent windows on the streaming response. Controlled by `CLAUDE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` env var (ms; `0` = disabled, default). Covers both pre-first-byte and mid-stream tool-use pauses. Addresses #47. See [design doc](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-47-sse-heartbeat-design.md).
- **`X-Accel-Buffering: no`** response header added to SSE responses so heartbeats survive nginx/Cloudflare default buffering.

### Behavior changes

- SSE headers are now sent immediately after the claude CLI spawns successfully, not on first stdout byte. The rare "spawn succeeded but subprocess died before any byte" path now closes the SSE stream cleanly rather than returning a JSON error.

### Config additions

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | `0` (disabled) | Interval in ms for SSE keepalive comment frames on streaming path. Resets on every real frame. |

## v3.11.1 — 2026-04-21

### Fixes
- Concurrency slot leak on subprocess timeout (#37). The request-timeout handler called `proc.kill("SIGTERM")` without decrementing `stats.activeRequests`. A subprocess stuck in a syscall that ignored SIGTERM would hold its slot until (or beyond) the 5s SIGKILL escalation actually reaped it. Slot release is now wired to `proc.once("exit", cleanup)` so every termination path — normal close, error, SIGTERM, SIGKILL — releases the slot exactly once.

## v3.11.0 — 2026-04-20

### Features
- `ocp update` now automatically syncs OpenClaw's registry with the latest models (scripts/sync-openclaw.mjs)
- Server logs warn if OpenClaw registry drifts from models.json

### Refactor
- models.json is now the single source of truth for model list
- server.mjs and setup.mjs derive MODEL_MAP/MODELS from models.json
- Adding a new model is now a one-file edit

### Fixes
- OpenClaw's model dropdown now shows all 4 current models (opus-4-7, opus-4-6, sonnet-4-6, haiku-4.5) on existing installs after `ocp update`. Previously setup.mjs only wrote the registry at install time.

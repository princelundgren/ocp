# OCP Project Session Instructions

> **WARNING — READ BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE IN THIS REPO**
>
> Before touching `server.mjs` or any network-facing surface, read [`./ALIGNMENT.md`](./ALIGNMENT.md) in full. The constitution is binding. Non-compliant commits are reverted.

---

## Before starting any task

1. Read `./ALIGNMENT.md`. Internalize the five Rules and the 2026-04-11 drift lesson.
2. Run `/dev-start <task description>` to get a pre-flight plan that incorporates the iron rules, `SKILL_ROUTING.md`, this file, and `ALIGNMENT.md`.
3. If the task touches `server.mjs`, locate the corresponding `cli.js` reference **before** drafting any code. No code is written ahead of the `grep cli.js` evidence.

---

## Hard requirements for `server.mjs` changes

Every PR that modifies `server.mjs` must satisfy all three of the following. A PR missing any one of them is blocked from merge.

1. **`cli.js` citation.** The commit message and PR body declare the corresponding `cli.js` function name and line number range, using the format `cli.js:NNNN` or `cli.js vE4 <functionName>`. If `cli.js` does not perform the operation, the PR must state this explicitly and justify scope under `ALIGNMENT.md` Rule 2 (in practice, this almost always means the PR should be closed).
2. **CI blacklist pass.** The `alignment.yml` workflow must pass. The workflow greps `server.mjs` for known-hallucinated tokens (currently blocking `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`) and fails the build on any hit. New tokens are added via PR amendment to `alignment.yml`; removing entries requires an `ALIGNMENT.md` amendment PR. Do not suppress the workflow.
3. **Independent reviewer (Iron Rule 10).** The implementation author may not self-approve. A separate reviewer — human or a subagent spawned with a fresh context — must read the diff, verify the `cli.js` citation by opening `cli.js` at the cited lines, and explicitly approve. A review comment that does not confirm the `cli.js` citation was checked is not a valid approval.

## Iron rules in force

This repo operates under the CC Development Iron Rules (CC 开发铁律) v1.3. Three rules are load-bearing for OCP work:

- **Iron Rule 10 (Code Review).** Every implementation phase has an independent reviewer. Self-review does not count. See `server.mjs` hard requirement #3 above.
- **Iron Rule 11 (Incremental Diff Review).** Non-trivial work is split into the minimum reviewable unit — one PR per layer per severity. `ALIGNMENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, the PR template, and the CI workflow are therefore shipped as the same constitutional PR (they are one layer: governance), but any subsequent `server.mjs` remediation lands as its own PR.
- **Iron Rule 12 (Pre-Brainstorm Prior-Art Search).** Before proposing any new endpoint or header, search GitHub, Anthropic docs, and the `cli.js` bundle. For OCP specifically, the `cli.js` grep is the decisive search: if it does not hit, Rule 2 of the constitution applies.

The full iron rules are at `~/.claude/CC_DEV_IRON_RULES.md` (symlinked from the cc-rules repo on the maintainer's workstations). Load them into session context with `/cc-rules` when needed.

## Skills relevant to this repo

- `/dev-start` — pre-flight planning, always first.
- `/cc-rules` — load the iron rules into context.
- `/agent-dispatch` — pick the correct model (opus for design and review, sonnet for straightforward edits, haiku for mechanical chores) before spawning any subagent.
- `/cc-mem search <keyword>` — look up cross-machine memory for prior decisions, especially prior drift incidents.

---

## Commit message conventions

- Subject line uses Conventional Commits (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).
- Any assertion of the form "Claude Code uses X" or "cli.js uses X" in the body must be immediately followed by a citation in the form `cli.js:NNNN` or `cli.js vE4 <functionName>`. CI performs a soft check for this pattern on all commits in the PR.

---

## Project-level escalation

If a design decision cannot be resolved by reference to `cli.js` and `ALIGNMENT.md`, escalate to the project maintainer via `/cc-chat` rather than guessing. Silent guessing is what produced the 2026-04-11 drift.

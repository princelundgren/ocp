// F7 fix (audit finding, LOW): the prefix used to be a bare, host-wide constant
// ("ocp-tui-"), so a SECOND OCP instance on the same host (e.g. a temporary
// verification instance stood up alongside production — a real pattern used during
// PR #144/#146 verification) would boot-reap and potentially kill-server the OTHER
// instance's LIVE sessions: the coexistence guard below only ever spared foreign
// PRODUCT prefixes (olp-tui-*), never a second ocp-tui-* instance on a different port.
//
// Fix: scope the prefix to the instance's own listen port. The port is the natural
// stable per-instance discriminator on one host (two OCP instances cannot share a
// port), so `ocp-tui-<port>-` uniquely namespaces this instance's sessions and makes
// a same-host sibling OCP instance look exactly like a foreign product (olp-tui-*) to
// the coexistence guard — its `ocp-tui-<otherPort>-*` sessions never match our own
// prefix and are therefore never reaped/kill-server'd by us.
//
// LEGACY_SESSION_PREFIX / LEGACY_SESSION_NAME_RE describe the OLD bare-prefix shape
// (pre-this-fix), retained ONLY for the boot-time legacy-zombie migration handled in
// reapStaleTuiSessions (see comment there). No code path in this version ever CREATES
// a legacy-shaped session name again — sessionPrefixForPort() is the only session-name
// prefix constructor used going forward.

// digits and the 8-hex suffix (see sessionPrefixForPort), so this regex can never match
// a new-shape name: a new-shape suffix is `<port digits>-<8 hex>` (contains a literal

// returns the instant the server forks the pane, so node never becomes its parent and
// therefore can NEVER waitpid()/reap it (a SIGKILL still needs the *parent* to reap, and
// here that parent is the tmux server). `kill-session` destroys the session but the server
// can leave the pane's `claude` (and any grandchildren claude spawned) as `<defunct>`
// zombies that only the server can reap. Over many per-request spawn+teardown cycles these
// accumulate (live evidence on PI231: 25 defunct `<claude>` over 30 days; `tmux kill-server`
// dropped it 25→3). The only node-reachable action that ACTUALLY reaps them — rather than
// merely re-signalling — is to stop the tmux server: when the server exits, the kernel
// reparents its surviving children to init (PID 1), which reaps them immediately.

// ── POOL/REAPER INVARIANT (warm pane pool — lib/tui/pool.mjs) ───────────────────────────
// A warm pooled pane is one of OUR OWN `ocp-tui-<port>-*` sessions that is ALIVE AND IDLE
// BY DESIGN — and the periodic sweep runs precisely when the instance is idle, i.e. exactly
// when the pool is full. Without an exemption the sweep would kill every warm pane on every
// tick (and kill-server on top). The exemption is `spare`: a set of EXACT session names the
// caller declares live. Three properties, all load-bearing:
//
//   1. A LIVE POOLED PANE IS NEVER REAPED — INCLUDING ONE THAT IS STILL BOOTING. It is in
//      `spare` (the pool's live registry), so it is skipped by name. The booting case is not
//      a footnote, it is the one that bit us: bootTuiPane creates the tmux session
//      SYNCHRONOUSLY and only then waits up to POOL_BOOT_MS for the input bar, so a pooled
//      session can be live for ~20 s before its boot resolves. The pool therefore mints the
//      pane's NAME up front and holds it in `_bootingPane`, so liveNames() can name — and
//      spare — a session whose boot has not finished. (An earlier version tracked only a
//      COUNT of in-flight boots; the sweep could not name that session and killed it.)
//   2. A LEAKED/ORPHANED POOLED PANE IS STILL REAPED. Membership is by EXACT NAME from a
//      live in-memory registry — NOT by "looks pooled" (name shape). A pane the pool no
//      longer owns (handed out, dropped, cancelled, or left behind by a previous process
//      generation — whose registry died with it) is absent from `spare` and is killed like
//      any other stale session. Fail-safe: forgetting to pass `spare` reaps MORE, never less.
//   3. KILL-SERVER NEVER KILLS A LIVE POOL PANE. A spared session suppresses kill-server
//      exactly as a foreign session does (it is a live child of the tmux server). The
//      consequence — that a permanently-full pool would permanently disable the defunct-
//      zombie reaping that ONLY kill-server can do — is resolved in server.mjs by DRAINING
//      the pool immediately before the sweep, so `spare` is empty on the normal tick and
//      kill-server still fires. `spare` is the belt-and-braces: a reap call site that
//      forgets to drain still cannot kill a live pane.
//
// `spare` (default: none) — iterable of session names, or a Set. Ignored when the pool is off.
//
// `includeLegacy` (default false): when true, sessions matching the exact OLD bare-prefix
// shape (LEGACY_SESSION_NAME_RE) are ALSO treated as ours for kill-session purposes. This is
// the boot-time legacy migration: an operator upgrading past this fix could otherwise be left
// with orphaned bare-prefix zombie sessions from the PREVIOUS (pre-fix) process generation of
// this SAME instance, since no live instance of the new version ever creates that shape again
// — a legacy-shaped session found at boot is therefore presumed to be this instance's own
// leftover, not a stranger's. Passed true ONLY from the one-time boot-reap call site in
// server.mjs; the periodic idle-reap sweep does NOT set it, so a lingering legacy session
// during steady-state is conservatively treated as foreign (correctly blocking kill-server)
// rather than assumed to be ours on every 15-minute tick. Residual (accepted, documented):
// if a genuinely-still-running PRE-FIX OCP instance is coexisting on the same host at the
// exact moment a new instance boots, its live legacy-shaped session could be reaped — the
// same class of residual risk the audit finding itself accepts ("no live instance of the new
// version creates them"); this PR does not regress that scenario, it only removes the far
// more common same-version collision (the actual F7 finding).

//   - ENV-TOKEN scratch-home (envTokenMode === true): a dedicated HOME with a seeded
//     .claude.json (onboarded + trusts only the scratch cwd) and its own projects/ dir,
//     and DELIBERATELY NO .credentials.json (no symlink, no copy). claude then has no
//     credentials file to read, so it authenticates via CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (passed

//     mode that SYMLINKS the real .credentials.json. Retained only for an operator who
//     explicitly set OCP_TUI_HOME without an env token; see the caveat below.
//
// WHY ENV-TOKEN MODE IS THE FIX (proven live on PI231, claude 2.1.104):
//   env token passed + a broken ~/.claude/.credentials.json present → 401.
//   env token passed + credentials.json moved aside              → real answer.
// Interactive `claude` PREFERS .credentials.json over the env var (unlike `-p`, where the
// env token wins), so a stale/corrupt credentials.json SHADOWS the env token. Passing the
// token is necessary but insufficient; the TUI claude must run in a HOME with NO
// credentials.json so the env token is the only credential. This ALSO ends the refresh-
// corruption incident at the root: with no credentials file, claude never runs the token-
// refresh path, so the single-use refresh token can never be rotated (and corrupted) by the
// spawn+kill cycle. (This RESOLVES — not reintroduces — the ADR 0007 scratch-home concern:
// the old caveat was about a SYMLINKED credentials.json being forked on refresh; here there
// is no credentials file to fork and no refresh ever happens.)
//
// ⚠️ LEGACY SCRATCH-HOME CAVEAT (envTokenMode falsy, symlink path): claude rewrites
// .credentials.json on token refresh, REPLACING the symlink with a regular-file copy → the
// scratch home FORKS the OAuth credentials and a refresh can invalidate the real-home token.
// That path is therefore safe only with a DEDICATED OAuth or for ephemeral use. The env-token

// cold-boot as usual.
// bootMs: max wait for the input bar. Defaults to BOOT_MS (the REQUEST path's cap, which is
// deliberately tight — a client is blocked on it). The POOL passes POOL_BOOT_MS instead: a
// background pre-boot has nobody waiting on it, and capping it at the request-path's 4 s
// made real refills fail (observed live: a refill booting alongside an in-flight turn took

// readiness wait returns, so a pool that only learned the name on resolve could neither spare
// the session from the reaper nor kill it on shutdown. Supplying BOTH also keeps the name's
// hex suffix equal to the session-id's, so `tmux ls` correlates to the transcript file.
// `streamDir` (optional, OCP_TUI_STREAM): install claude's MessageDisplay hook on this pane.
// Done HERE, at boot — not at turn time — and that is the whole reason streaming survives the
// WARM POOL: the hook script + settings file are STATIC (one pair per streamDir), and the only

// per fire while the turn is still generating. A WARM pane already carries its sink from boot

// but THIS particular request non-streaming (stream:false) must still get the SAME argv whether
// it lands on a pool HIT or a cold-boot MISS, because a pre-booted pool pane cannot know in
// advance whether the request it will eventually serve wants streaming — it installs the hook
// unconditionally whenever the pool is warming at all (see server.mjs's bootPane closure). Gating
// the cold boot's hook install on `onDelta` made a stream:false request's argv depend on whether
// it happened to hit the pool or miss it — the exact drift this surface cannot tolerate. Whether
// the hook is actually POLLED is a separate, correctly-scoped decision: see `streaming` below,
// gated on onDelta && streamFile, so a non-streaming turn never reads its own sink even though
// the hook is running.
//
// The transcript stays AUTHORITATIVE regardless: it is still the terminal-turn signal, still the
// source of the returned `text`, and still the input to the caller's honesty gates. The delta
// stream is a low-latency MIRROR of it, never a replacement, and the caller asserts the two
// agree. With onDelta AND streamDir both omitted, nothing here changes: no poll, no hook.

# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the OCP Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — short documents that capture the **why** behind structural choices.

Read these before proposing governance, SPOT (single-source-of-truth), or process changes.

## Numbering

ADRs start at `0002`. The first one (`0001`) was reserved for an early
internal proposal that was superseded before publication; `0002` is
deliberately the first published record so the archived `0001` slot
remains a placeholder rather than being silently renumbered.

New ADRs increment from the highest existing number. Filenames are
`NNNN-<short-slug>.md`.

## Index

| ADR | Title | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| [0002](0002-alignment-constitution.md) | Alignment Constitution | The `ALIGNMENT.md` constitution: why every `server.mjs` change requires `cli.js` citation + independent reviewer + CI blacklist pass. Background: the 2026-04-11 drift incident. |
| [0003](0003-models-json-spot.md) | `models.json` as SPOT | Why model IDs / aliases / context windows live in a single JSON file (not duplicated in `server.mjs` and `setup.mjs` arrays). v3.11.0 refactor. |
| [0004](0004-openclaw-auto-sync.md) | OpenClaw Auto-Sync | Why `scripts/sync-openclaw.mjs` runs on `ocp update`, what its scope boundary is (writes only `models.providers["claude-local"].models` and `agents.defaults.models["claude-local/*"]`), and the idempotency contract. |
| [0005](0005-no-multi-provider.md) | No Multi-Provider | Why OCP stays single-provider (Anthropic-via-cli.js) and does not extend to OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter. Cost estimate: ~7 weeks for a v1 that buys neither moat nor commercial readiness. Separate commercial work starts in a separate repo. |
| [0006](0006-openai-shim-scope.md) | OpenAI Shim Scope | The Class A / Class B taxonomy. Class A endpoints (`cli.js`-mirror) keep Rules 1–5 verbatim; Class B endpoints (OCP-owned compatibility surface — `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`, admin endpoints) are anchored to OpenAI's spec (B.1) or to an authorizing ADR (B.2). Triggered by PR #99 (external `response_format` honoring). Grandfathers the existing B.2 inventory at v3.16.4. |
| [0007](0007-tui-interactive-mode.md) | TUI Interactive Mode | Why TUI-mode spawns an interactive `claude` in a tmux pane (no `-p`) to reach the **subscription** billing pool (`cc_entrypoint=cli`) rather than the metered Agent SDK pool. Owns the TUI spawn machinery: entrypoint labeling, credential-isolated home, MCP hard-disable, session namespace + defunct-session reaping, the independent concurrency bound, and the `/health` `tui` block. **Single-user only** — hard FATAL on multi-user configs. |
| [0008](0008-tui-warm-pane-pool.md) | TUI Warm Pane Pool | Why `OCP_TUI_POOL_SIZE` pre-boots **single-use** `claude` panes (one turn each, own `--session-id`) — and why reuse is forbidden (`transcript.mjs` returns the last assistant entry in the file, so a reused session leaks the earlier turn's text). Measured −41% end-to-end. Defines the pool↔reaper invariant (exemption by exact name from a live registry; drain before every sweep so `kill-server` zombie reaping survives) and the standing idle-process cost. Extends ADR 0007. |
| [0009](0009-spot-derived-prompt-budget.md) | SPOT-Derived Prompt Budget | Why `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`'s default is `max(models.json contextWindow) × 3 chars/token` (600k chars today) instead of a hand-set constant — the old 150k silently under-delivered the advertised window ~5×. ×3 is the CJK-safe multiplier; env/settings stay absolute overrides; whether to advertise 1M windows is explicitly a separate decision. |

## When to write a new ADR

Open one whenever:

- A structural rule is being added or changed (e.g., new SPOT, new boundary, new CI guardrail).
- A decision encodes a lesson from an incident or drift.
- A future contributor reading the code alone could plausibly undo or re-litigate the choice.

Skip ADRs for routine implementation choices (algorithm pick, naming) — those belong in commit messages.

## Format

Keep ADRs short — Context / Decision / Consequences is the standard skeleton. Cite incidents, PRs, or commits where useful.
